# Goal: compute the average (across instruments) weights on MTRs
#
# The average weights are piecewise-constant functions of u.
# The `compute_average_weights` function will return a data frame that stores
# value of the average weight at the endpoints of each nontrivial piece.
#   1. value of u
#   2. average weight for d = 1
#   3. average weight for d = 0
#
# The average weights for IV-like estimands rely on the s(d, z) function.
# The average weights for target parameters are derived manually.
