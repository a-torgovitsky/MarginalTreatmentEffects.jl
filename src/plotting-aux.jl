# TODO(omkarakatta): consider getting rid of `isnothing(steps)` conditional?

This function returns a vector of strings. Each string is of the form
    "(x, y)(x, y) ‚ãØ (x, y)"
where each (x, y) tuple is a coordinate for the `addplot` command.
Each string of coordinates is associated with its own `addplot` command.
Consequently, all the (x, y) tuples within a string will be connected;
the (x, y) tuples across different strings will not be connected.
This design is useful when there are discontinuities.

The primary use of this function is to plot the following:
    1. weights associated with IV-like estimands and target parameters
    2. MTRs

The MTRs and the weights use different strategies for creating their
coordinates because we know the weights are piecewise-constant. Hence, we can
draw them without any sort of approximation. To ensure there are tick marks
within each piece, new points need to be introduced within each piece (see the
`steps` argument).

On the other hand, we don't know where the MTRs are discontinuous.
So, we discover where they have discontinuities by checking the slopes of the
secant lines between two consecutive points. If the magnitude of the slopes is
larger than `disctol`, then we have found a discontinuity. These
discontinuities determine the segments.

# Parameters

- df,xindex,yindex: df[:, xindex] and df[:, yindex] contains (x, y) pairs
- steps: By default, this option is not specified, in which case, no new points
    will be introduced. If a number is specified, then new points will be
    introduced on the line segment between two points:
        (df[i, xindex], df[i, yindex]) and (df[i + 1, xindex], df[i, yindex]).
    The distance between these new points will be `steps` units.
- disctol: If the secant line between two consecutive points is larger than
    this value, then we consider there to be a discontinuity. As a result, a
    new entry will be made in the output vector.
