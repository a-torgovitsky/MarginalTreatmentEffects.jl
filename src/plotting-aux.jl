# Create coordinates for \addplot
# If `steps` is not specified, return a vector of coordinates, where
#   discontinuities separate vectors from one another.
#   This is particularly useful when drawing the MTRs.
# If `steps` is specified, return a vector of coordinates (i.e., endpoints)
#   `steps` controls how far apart the points are.
#   This is particularly useful when drawing tick marks for the weights.
# The MTRs and the weights use different strategies for creating their
# coordinates because we know the weights are piecewise-constant. Hence, we can
# draw them without approximation. On the other hand, we don't know where the
# MTRs are discontinuous. So, we discover where they have discontinuities by
# checking the slopes of the secant lines between two consecutive points. If
# the magnitude of the slopes is larger than `tol`, then we have found a
# discontinuity. These discontinuities determine the segments.
#
# TODO: is there a way to combine these two frameworks? Maybe using the basis
# for the MTRs can help determine whether we should "discover" the cutoffs...?
# TODO: use multiple dispatch to get rid of `isnothing(steps)` conditional.
